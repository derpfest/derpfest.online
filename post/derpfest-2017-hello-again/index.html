    <h1>DerpFest’17 – Hello Again!</h1>
    <p>As you may have already found out since you're reading this, Derp Fest 2017 has been recently
announced to take place on November 4<sup>th</sup>. We are currently working to ensure that
you enjoy the convention as much as we enjoyed organizing it. But first, let me share with you
some info that may be of help in case you are planning to attend this year's Derp Fest.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Probably the most important thing you should know is that this time we are making an
international convention rather than local as usual, and that means we are ready to provide
all the necessary support to our English-speaking visitors, including help with planning your
trip to Moscow, getting a Russian visa, and finding appropriate accommodations (all the
relevant information will be added to the site's information section later). If you have any
questions that were for some reason left out, or if you need some info and cannot afford to
wait for it to get posted, feel free to contact anybody from our International Relations
department staff:</p>

</ul>

<p>And now for something more interesting: in addition to main event, we are also going to host
LARP on November 3<sup>rd</sup> (Friday). We hope it will help you to get more familiar with
Moscow city as well as meet new friends and maybe even win something!</p>

<p>During the concert day (November 4th) you'll be able to enjoy music played live by many local
brony musicians and bands. Some of them are even considered to be classic brony music in our
fandom. Others, however, are going to make their appearance for the first time and it will be
up to everyone to support them and make them shine!</p>

<p>Sadly, this is all that I have for now but I promise there's going to be more info soon so
stay tuned and enjoy the ride.</p>
