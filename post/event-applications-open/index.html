    <h1>Event applications are now open!</h1>
    <p>It's been quite some time since the last post and we are very sorry for that but here are some
good news: we are finally ready to open event applications! It means that if you have ever
wanted to participate in a convention and have a great idea but never got a chance to shine,
now is your chance to make it in the Derp Fest program.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you already have something specific in mind and know what kind of event is best for your
idea, feel free to skip this post altogether and proceed to
<a href="/program/registration/">the event registration page</a>. Otherwise, pour yourself some tea and
enjoy a moderate explanation of each type. There are three of them and we are going to start
with the easiest one: a panel.</p>

<h2 id="panels">Panels</h2>
<p>Panel is probably the most well-known event kind. It is perfect for lectures, showcases, and
discussions. <!-- not sure what to write here, pulled out some things out of head but they are
not ok --> However, time is the most limiting factor since there is a very limited number of
free slots in the schedule. If you need a lot of time, it is better to take a look at other
event formats and see if they are more suitable for what you have planned.</p>

<h2 id="workshops">Workshops</h2>
<p>If your want to show your skills and to teach people something new, a workshop may be the most
suitable option. Being able to get advice and guidance from a more experienced person can be
very beneficial when learning something practical. You may even be able to inspire people to
take up a new hobby or help improve their skills. We will also gladly help you with equipment
or materials if you need them.</p>

<h2 id="activity-zones">Activity Zones</h2>
<p>Panels and workshops do not really need a lengthy explanation since everybody knows what they
are but an Activity Zone concept does require some. Simply put, an Activity Zone is the least
restricted event format you can think of. There are no restrictions on what you can and cannot
do there and all ideas ranging from a video game demo zone to a ball pit are welcome! We will
provide you with a designated area of negotiable size in one of the event halls, some
equipment, if necessary, and help in setting things up.</p>

<p>Now that you have a grasp on what kind of event you can run at Derp Fest, feel free to use
<a href="/program/registration">the event registration page</a> to apply and help us make Derp Fest an
even better convention!</p>
